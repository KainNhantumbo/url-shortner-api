### Disclaimer

This application was made for pratice, learn and for improving my
coding skills only. Do not use this application for commercial or
professional purposes but you're free to test. Please understand that
all saved shortned urls are periodicaly deleted from the database to avoid higher server costs and that will lead them
to stop working.
